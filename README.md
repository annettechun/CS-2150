CS 2150 (Program and Data Representation)

CS 2150 utilized C++ coding through Unix.

For this course, I was introduced to program and data representation from high level
concepts to machine level implementation. Data structuring techniques and the representation
of data structures during program execution were discussed, as were operations and control
structures and their representation during program execution. Representations of numbers,
arithmetic operations, arrays, records, recusion, hashing, stacks, queues, trees, graphs,
and related concepts were also covered.

In total, there were 12 lab assignments each with three linked parts: a pre-lab, in-lab, and post-lab.

Listed below are the main topics that each lab focused on:

Lab 1: Introduction to C++

Lab 2: Linked Lists

Lab 3: Stacks

Lab 4: Number Representation

Lab 5: Trees

Lab 6: Hashing

Lab 7: IBCM (machine language)

Lab 8: x86, part 1 (assembly language)

Lab 9: x86, part 2 (assembly language)

Lab 10: Huffman coding

Lab 11: Graphs

Lab 12: Objective C
